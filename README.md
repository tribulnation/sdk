# Tribulnation Trading SDKs

This repository contains abstract trading SDKs for building automated crypto trading systems and bots, available in both Python and Rust. These SDKs provide unified, type-safe interfaces for trading, market data, and wallet operations, enabling rapid development and code reuse across multiple exchanges and platforms.

## Overview

- **Unified async interfaces for trading, market data, and wallet operations**
- **Type-safe, extensible design for robust automation**
- **Consistent error handling and clear API boundaries**
- **Designed for easy implementation and extension for any exchange**
- **Available in both Python ([sdk/](sdk/)) and Rust ([rust/](rust/))**

Both SDKs are intended to be implemented by other projects for specific exchanges, allowing you to write automation logic once and reuse it everywhere.

## Get Started

- See the [Python SDK README](sdk/README.md) for details and usage examples in Python.
- See the [Rust SDK README](rust/README.md) for details and usage examples in Rust.
